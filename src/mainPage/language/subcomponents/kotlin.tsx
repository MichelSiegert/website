      Kotlin has rapidly become the language of choice for Android development, thanks to its modern syntax, safety features, and seamless interoperability with Java. With hands-on experience in Kotlin, I develop high-quality, responsive Android applications that prioritize user experience and performance.

      In my work with Kotlin, I utilize the Android ecosystem’s most powerful tools and libraries, including:

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>UI & UX Design:</strong>
            {' '}
            ConstraintLayout, Material Design, Custom Views
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Testing & Debugging:</strong>
            {' '}
            Espresso, JUnit, MockK
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      Through these tools, I create applications that are efficient, user-friendly, and optimized for performance on diverse Android devices. My focus is on building apps that are both scalable and maintainable, with Kotlin’s concise syntax and robust features enabling clean, error-free code.
