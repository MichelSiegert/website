        TypeScript is a cornerstone of modern web development, known for its powerful features that enhance both reliability and scalability. With several years of experience writing TypeScript code in professional settings, I leverage this language to build clean, efficient, and maintainable applications.

        I have extensive experience working with key frameworks and tools within the TypeScript ecosystem, including:
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend:</strong>
            {' '}
            Angular, Vue, React
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend:</strong>
            {' '}
            Node.js, Express
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Testing & Automation:</strong>
            {' '}
            Jest, Cypress
          </li>
        </ul>
        Note that this is not an exhausticve list, many business usecases have required different frameworks.
      </div>
      <div>
        By combining TypeScript with these frameworks and tools, I create robust applications that meet complex business needs while ensuring code quality and consistency across the development lifecycle.
