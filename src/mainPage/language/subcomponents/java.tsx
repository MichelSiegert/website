      Java is a cornerstone of enterprise software development, powering scalable, secure, and high-performance applications across industries. With extensive experience in Java, I specialize in creating robust backend systems and well-structured applications that deliver reliability and efficiency.
      I am skilled in working with a range of popular Java frameworks, tools, and libraries, including:
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend Development:</strong>
            {' '}
            Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Hibernate
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Testing & Automation:</strong>
            {' '}
            JUnit, Mockito, Cucumber
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      Through leveraging these frameworks, I build Java applications that are both modular and maintainable, adhering to industry best practices. Whether developing RESTful APIs, working with relational databases, I emphasize performance and scalability at every step. By choosing Java, I deliver software that meets the rigorous demands of today’s enterprise environments.
