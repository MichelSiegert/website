Python is one of the most powerful and versatile languages for machine learning, thanks to its extensive library ecosystem and ease of use. With a strong foundation in Python, I specialize in developing machine learning models and data pipelines that drive insights and innovation.

In my machine learning work, I leverage Python’s most popular libraries and frameworks, including:

<div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Manipulation & Analysis:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, </li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning & Deep Learning:</strong> TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV</li>
        <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Matplotlib, Seaborn</li>
    </ul>
</div>
By combining these tools, I build, train, and evaluate machine learning models that are accurate, scalable, and efficient. From developing deep learning models with TensorFlow and Keras to processing and analyzing large datasets with Pandas and NumPy, I am dedicated to creating data-driven solutions that meet complex challenges. My experience spans tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and NLP.
