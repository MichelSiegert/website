        JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development, enabling dynamic,
        interactive, and user-friendly applications across platforms.
        With extensive experience in JavaScript within business environments,
        I build responsive, high-performance applications that
        drive user engagement and meet business objectives.
      </div>
      <div>
        I have a strong command of JavaScript and have worked with
        key frameworks, libraries, and tools, including:
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend:</strong>
            {' '}
            React, Vue, Angular
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend:</strong>
            {' '}
            Node.js, Express, NestJS
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Testing & Automation:</strong>
            {' '}
            Jest, Cypress
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        By leveraging JavaScript’s flexibility across these frameworks
        and tools, I develop highly scalable, maintainable Applications
        that perform seamlessly across devices and browsers. My focus is
        on creating applications that are both user-centric and technically
        sound, optimized for modern development needs.
